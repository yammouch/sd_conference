\section{Introduction}

Electronic design automation (EDA) has applied a positive feedback
for computer design by deploying computers themselves,
introducing an acceleration to growth of computing power
and achieving an exponential growth, along with Mooreâ€™s law.
Increasing the transistor count,
functionality of electronic devices and their complexity of design,
EDA has supported the development, by means of circuit simulator,
logic synthesis, high-level synthesis, automatic layout,
design rule checker, kinds of equivalence checkers,
automatic test pattern generator (ATPG), etc.
Those EDA tools handle topology information expressed as text data
called netlist which is easy for computer to deal with.
As well, output data from EDA are also text-based netlist,
which are result of automatic layout, result of parasitic extraction, etc.
Those text-based data often have to be manually analyzed
for debug or engineering change order (ECO),
but the analysis is error prone,
so schematics are often drawn down from netlist manually.
Schematic is more readable and understandable than text-based netlist,
so electronic circuitry is designed on schematic,
especially for analogue circuit.
Even though digital circuit is often designed
on hardware description language (HDL),
schematics are useful for complex and clock-cycle-timing-critical design,
e.g., pipeline \cite{ph}.
So far, methods to automatically generate schematic from netlist or HDL
have been proposed
\cite{nauts}
\cite{anshul}
\cite{fiduccia}
\cite{chun}
\cite{green}
\cite{tsung}
\cite{bogdan}.

Each of them focuses only on one of analog circuit,
gate level netlist of digital circuit
or more higher level HDL visualization.
And the best shape of schematic is likely to depend on
type of circuit, each project, or each individual.
Recently, interest to machine learning is raining,
and some studies have applied machine-learning-based techniques
to unprecedented realm of EDA \cite{fan} \cite{sourav}.
Among machine learning techniques,
deep neural network has demonstrated great performance
in application of recognizing field data
expanded on 2-dimensional space,
e.g., bitmap image or board game field \cite{nips} \cite{alphago}.

This study proposes a novel method to combine schematic expression
which is another 2-dimensional field data
and deep neural network to automatically manipulate schematics
and to achieve human-readable ones, based on its training result.
Schematics are encoded to vectors so that the neural network can accept them.
The encoded schematics and corresponding preferred schematic edit commands,
which are also encoded and do not change semantics of schematics,
are given as training data.
After training, schematics which are not a part of training data
are fed to trained neural network,
and the neural network makes given schematics aesthetic.

\section{Concept}

\begin{figure}[!tp]
 \begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{\hsize}
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{fig/nn_schem_05.eps}
   \caption{Training and querying neural network.}
   \label{fig:nn_schem}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

This section describes how a neural network is
combined with schematic diagrams.
Figure \ref{fig:nn_schem} shows the basic concept.
The neural network will aestheticize given schematics after training.

Training phase is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:nn_schem} (a), (a'), (b) and (b')
where pairs of a schematic diagram and a preferred edit command
to make it cleaner are given to the neural network.
The neural network updates its internal parameters as knowledge obtained
from the training.
Note that training data are input to output layer
as well as input layer in traning phase,
even though the name is {\it output layer}.
After training, the neural network generates schematic edit commands
from the output layer for one the network has even not experienced,
as shown (c) and (c') in Fig.\ \ref{fig:nn_schem}.

\begin{figure}[!tb]
 \begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{\hsize}
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{fig/deep_feedforward_02.eps}
   \caption{A deep feedforward network.}
   \label{fig:deep_feedforward}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

In this study, an neural network architecture called
{\it deep feedforward network} is used,
and it is trained by {\it stochastic gradient descent} (SGD)\cite{mit}.
Figure \ref{fig:deep_feedforward} shows an example of deep feedforward network.
It consists of an input layer, some hidden layers and an output layer,
without a feedback path.
Based on trained parameters ${\bm \theta}_n$,
it generates an output vector denoted as $\hat{\bf y}$ here
which corresponds to preferred edit command for a given input vector
${\bf u}$, an encoded schematic diagram.
Formally, $\hat{\bf y}$ is calculated as,
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\bf y} &=& {\bf x}_N \\
{\bf x}_n &=& a_n({\bf z}_n) \\
{\bf z}_n &=& f_n({\bf x}_{n-1}, {\bm \theta}_n)\\
{\bf x}_0 &=& {\bf u}
\end{eqnarray}
where $N$ is the total number of hidden and output layers,
$n$ is an integer ranging from 1 to $N$.
$f_n$ is a weight function to weigh input elements of the layer.
$a_n$ is an activation function,
typically clipping too large or too small output values of $f_n$.
As described below,
SGC updates ${\bm \theta}_n$ so that it reduces an error
between $\hat{\bf y}$ and ${\bf y}$,
where ${\bf y}$ is a vector of training data.
Given an loss function
$L({\bf u},{\bm \theta}_1,\cdots,{\bm \theta}_N,{\bf y})$
which evaluates the error between $\hat{\bf y}$ and ${\bf y}$,
${\bm \theta}_n$ is updated as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bm \theta}_n \leftarrow
(1-\lambda){\bm \theta}_n
- \epsilon
  \sum_{i=1}^M
  \frac{\partial L({\bf u}_i,{\bm \theta}_1,\cdots,{\bm \theta}_N,{\bf y}_i)}
       {\partial {\bm \theta}_n}\label{eqn:sgd}
\end{eqnarray}
where an input vector ${\bf u}_i$ is accompanied with a subscript $i$
to show that ${\bf u}_i$ is an array of vector randomly picked up
from training data set.
${\bf y}_i$ are a vector array, too.
The number of vectors $M$ is called {\it minibatch size}.
$\lambda$ is weight decay to above overfitting,
$\epsilon$ is learning rate.
Values smaller than 1 and slightly more than 0 are chosen
for $\lambda$ and $\epsilon$.
By repeatedly applying the equation \ref{eqn:sgd},
the parameter ${\bm \theta}_n$ gets close to the optimal value.

 \begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{\hsize}
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{fig/encode_01.eps}
   \caption{Schamatics and commands encoding.}
   \label{fig:encode}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

It is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:encode} how to encode
schematics and edit commands so that the neural network can accept them.
Figure \ref{fig:encode} (a) shows a schematic composed of
inputs ports, output ports, an and-gate, a not-gate,
horizontal nets, vertical nets, and a connecting point.
In this study, elements on a schematic diagram are
mapped onto 3-dimensional space.
Figure \ref{fig:encode} (b) picks up horizontal nets appearing
in Fig.\ \ref{fig:encode} (a), and they are mapped to depth 0.
The depth 0 is composed of a 2-dimensional matrix which size is the same
as given schematic.
In the right side of Fig.\ \ref{fig:encode} (b),
dots appear at coordinates where horizontal nets exist.
A dot is mapped to a value of 1.0.
Other points correnspond to 0.0.
As shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:encode} (c),
vertical nets are mapped to depth 1.
As well, connecting dots, input ports, output ports, not-gates and and-gates
are mapped to depth 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.

Figure \ref{fig:encode} (e) shows how to encode schematic edit commands
As can be seen also in Fig.\ \ref{fig:nn_schem},
a command consists of following 4 elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item command, either move-x or move-y
\item origin-x
\item origin-y
\item destination
\end{itemize}
Move-x means to move a circuit element horizontally,
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:nn_schem} (b').
Move-y is for vertically moving, as shown (a') and (c')
of Fig.\ \ref{fig:nn_schem} (a') and (c').
In Fig.\ \ref{fig:nn_schem} (a'), 
the command `move-x (2, 1) to 4' can be seen,
where origin-x, origin-y and destination are 2, 1 and 4 respectively.
It means to horizontally move an element at the coordinate (2, 1) to (2, 4).
Each edit command element is encoded in one-hot style
as shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:encode} (e).
Move-x is encoded to the vector $[1.0, 0.0]$, 
while move-y is encoded to the vector $[0.0, 0.1]$. 
Origin-x is encoded to one-hot vector, which is
\begin{itemize}
\item $[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, \cdots]$ for 0,
\item $[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, \cdots]$ for 1, 
\item $[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, \cdots]$ for 2,
\end{itemize}
and so on.
For origin-x, the length of the one-hot vector is the width of
the schematic diagram.
The origin-y is also encoded to one-hot vector which length is
height of the schematic diagram.
As well, destination is one-hot vector which length is
maximum value of width and height of the schematic.
Output vector of the neural network is obtained
by concatenating those 4 one-hot vectors.

For weight function $f$, one shown Fig. \ref{fig:layer_convolutional}
is used to extract local characteristics on a field.
In this case, inputs to and outputs from $f$ are regarded as
3-dimensional arrays which are denoted as $x_{j,k,l}$ for input,
$z_{j,k,l}$ for output with 3 subscripts.
With 4-dimensional parameter $\theta_{i,j,k,l}$,
the output $z_{j,k,l}$ is calculated as;
\begin{eqnarray}
z_{i,k,l} = \sum_{j}\sum_{l}\sum_{m}
\theta_{i,j,l,m} x_{j,k - \lfloor w/2 \rfloor + l,l - \lfloor h/2 \rfloor + m}
\end{eqnarray}
where $w$ and $h$ are width and height of the parameter space
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:layer_convolutional}.
Layers containing this calculation are called ``convolutional layer.''

A way shown in Fig. \ref{fig:layer_fully_connected} is also used for $f$.
It globally weighs the parameter to extract global characteristics,
especially from one locally extracted.
In this case, inputs to and outputs from $f$ can be regarded as
1-dimensional arrays which are denoted as $x_j$ for input,
$z_j$ for output with a subscript.
With 2-dimensional parameter $\theta_{i,j}$,
the output $z_j$ is calculated as;
\begin{eqnarray}
z_i = \sum_{j} \theta_{i,j} x_{j}
\end{eqnarray}
Layers containing this calculation are called ``fully connected layer.''

For activation function $a$, following sigmoid function is used:
\begin{eqnarray}
a(z) = \frac{1}{1-e^{-z}}
\end{eqnarray}
Figure \ref{fig:curves} (a) shows sigmoid function,
which clips large negative values to 0, large positive values to 1,
to digitize outputs of weight function.
The following softmax function is also used for activation:
\begin{eqnarray}
a(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}
\end{eqnarray}
It emphasized a maximum value in its input vector.

For loss function $L$, the most simple one is following Euclidean distance:
\begin{eqnarray}
L(\hat{\bf y}, {\bf y}) = \sum_{i}(\hat{y_i} - y_i)^2
\end{eqnarray}
Figure \ref{fig:curves} (b) and (c) shows Euclidean distance
as a function of $\hat{y_i}$, where $y_i$ is 0 in (b) and 1 in (c).
In this study, another function called cross entropy function is used
which evaluates the error between $\hat{y_i}-y_i$ more significantly,
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:curves} (d) for $y_i = 0$, (e) for $y_i = 1$.
The cross entropy function is formally denoted as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
L(\hat{\bf y}, {\bf y}) =
\sum_i \left[ - y_i \log \hat{y_i} - (1-y_i) \log (1-\hat{y_i}) \right]
\end{eqnarray}

Schematics shown in Fig. \ref{fig:training_data} are used for this experiments.
Each one contains one input port, one not gate and one output port.
It also contains an unnecessary ring which will be removed
by the edit commands generated by the trained neural network.
Each schematic has 9 variations with
$w$ of 2, 3 and 4, for the widht of the ring,
$h$ of 2, 3 and 4, for the height of the ring.
So $9 \times 4 = 36$ different schematic patterns are introduced.
The schematic dimension is 10 grids $\times$ 10 grids.
There is margin around the schematics,
so the schematics can be placed various position on schematic field.
Finally, several steps are introduced to achieve a clean schematics.
The total numbers of schematic-edit-command pairs amounts up to about 1000.

Figure \ref{fig:layers} shows a layer structure of neural network.
The input layer has width of 10, height of 10,
depth of 6 for horizontal net, vertical net, connecting dot, input port,
output port and not gate.
The first hidden layer is a convolutional layer \cite{mit},
where kernel dimension is $3\times 3$, output depth is 4.
The first hidden layer is activated by sigmoid function.
The second hidden layer is another convolutional layer,
where kernel dimension is $3\times 3$, output depth is 4,
activated by sigmoid function.
The output layer is a dense layer.
The input vector size of the output layer
is detemined by product of schematic dimension
and output length of previous layer, which is $10 \times 10 \times 4$.
The output length of the layer is sum of 2 for command type,
10 for origin-x, 10 for origin-y and 10 for destination.

The following hyper-parameters are used:
0.1 for learning rate, 16 for minibatch size, 10000 of traning iteration.
The program is written in Java and Clojure,
a Lisp dialect running of Java Virtual Machine.

The output layer is activated by softmax function.
The (a) of Fig. \ref{fig:partial_softmax} shows a conventional softmax
function shown in \cite{mit}.
It emphasizes the maximum value in the input vector,
by dividing exponential function of each input by the sum of those.
Softmax function is introduced to pickup one element of vector.
In this study, it is not suitable to pick up only one element
amoung mixture of command type, origin-x, origin-y and destination.
but is preferable to pick up them from each part of the vector independently.
Then the partial softmax shown in (b) of Fig. \ref{fig:partial_softmax}
is used where softmax function is applied
for the first 2 elements for command type,
the next 10 elements for origin-x, 10 for origin-y and last 10 for destination.

\section{Result}

\begin{figure}[!tp]

   \caption{steps to make the schematic aesthetic by trained neural network.}
   \label{fig:edit_steps}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:edit_steps} shows steps of circuit edit
automatically generated from the trained neural network.
For this result, 12 schematic patterns are used for traning
out of 36 patterns shown in Fig. \ref{fig:training_data}.
A schematic unused for traning is picked up,
then challenged by the tranined neural network.
In Fig. \ref{fig:edit_steps}, filled square shows the origin-x and y
for each step.
At step 1, the top net of the unnecessary ring is grabbed and moved lower
to remove the ring.
At step 2, the edge of salient net is grabbed,
and moved to the adjacent cross point.
At step 3, the net connected to the input port is grabbed .
Finally, at step 4, the input port is moved upward
and a clean schematic is achived.
The neural network succeeded in clean up a schematic
which the network has never experienced.

   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{fig/errors.eps}
   \caption{convergence of error}
   \label{fig:errors}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:errors} shows a error appearing learning phase.
The horizontal axes is traning iteration up to 10000.
The vertical axes is the sum of squared errors between
neural network output and training data for output layer.
Convergence can be seen there.
It takes 60 seconds to finish 10000 training iterations.

\begin{figure}[!tp]
 \begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{\hsize}
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{fig/test_data.eps}
   \caption{rate of success of revising the schematics}
   \label{fig:test_data}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

This experiment has been performed varing the number of schematic patterns.
Figure \ref{fig:test_data} shows the result.
The horizontal axes shows the number of schematic patterns used for traninig
out of 36 patterns in total.
Patterns not in the traning data are challeged to be cleaned up.
The vertical axes shows the rate of success.
Success means that a clean schematic
without a overcrossing or unnecessary corner is achived
like the bottom subfigure of Fig. \ref{fig:edit_steps}.
Even when trained with only 4 patterns,
the neural network can clean up about 50\% of schematic.
When trained with 12 patterns,
which corresponds to one third of all schematic patterns,
the rate of success exceeds 90\%.
When trained with 24 patterns,
which corresponds to two thirds of all schematic patterns,
the rate reached to 100\%.


\section{Conclusions}

An novel way to achieve aesthetic schematic is proposed.
Deep neural network is used, and it learns how to edit schematic
from edit history obtained from human.
The trained neural network cleans up unnecessary part of given schematics,
which the neural network has not experienced.
Even the neural network is short of traning data,
it can clean up unknown schematics to a certain extent.
With enough training data,
the trained neural network can clean up almost of schematic.
