{\small\textbf{Abstract---
 Aesthetic schematics are inevitable to analyze, discuss and debug designs,
while they are often not available.
 This study shows a way to make a schematic cleaner which is written manually
 or automatically generated from netlist or HDL.
 Neural network is introduced and trained with schematic data and
 editting command.
 The trained neural network generates schematic editting command for schematics
 which the network does not know, and it aestheticize the given schematics
 automatically, based on its training.
}}

\section{Introduction}

For a long time and even nowadays,
electronic devices increases their functionality day by day.
The more one has functions, the more difficult the debugging is.

So far, some way have been proposed to automatically generate schematics
from netlist or HDL 
\cite{nauts}
\cite{anshul}
\cite{fiduccia}
\cite{chun}
\cite{green}
\cite{tsung}
\cite{bogdan}
They optimize schematics based on some cost function, e.g.,
the number of crossing point, curve, aspect ratio etc.
On the other hand, optimal shapes of schematics differ for each kind of
circuit, e.g. opamp, reference, oscillator, counter, arithmetic unit,
finite state automaton, etc.
The shape preference depends even on each individual.

The contribution of this work is to apply neural network to make schematics
aesthetic, based on training with test pattern generated by human.

%Figure {\ref{fig:flow}} shows a concept how to obtain an aesthetic schamatic.
%It has a neural network which learns pairs of schematic and editting command
%issued by a human.
%Whichever the schematic is given by a conventional schematic generator
%or other human,
%the trained neural network update the schematic.

Figure \ref{fig:nn_schem} shows a basic concept.
Multilayer neural network described in \cite{mit} is used
to make schematics aesthetic, based on training data created by human.
The input of the neural network is schematic.
The schematics are encoded into 1-dimensional vectors as described later,
so that neural network can accept the schematics.
The output of the neural network is edit command for the schematic.
The edit commands are also encoded into 1-dimensional vector.
Any edit command does not change the semantics of the schematic.
The neural network has parameters to calculate optimal schematic edit command.
The parameters are updated by training.

The command consists of following 4 elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item command, either move-x or move-y
\item origin-x
\item origin-y
\item destination
\end{itemize}
Move-x means to move circuit elements horizontally, as shown (b')
of Fig. \ref{fig:nn_schem}.
Move-y is for vertically moving, as shown (a') and (c')
of Fig. \ref{fig:nn_schem}.
In (a') of Fig. \ref{fig:nn_schem}, 
the command `move-x (2, 1) to 4' can be seen,
where origin-x, origin-y and destination are 2, 1 and 4 respectively.
It means to horizontally move an element at the coordinate (2, 1) to (2, 4).

In Fig. \ref{fig:nn_schem}, (a), (a'), (b) and (b') show training phase.
The neural network parameters are updated by given schematic on input layer
of the nerual network, and given edit command on output side.
It is noted that training data are exposed to output layer
as well as input layer in traning phase,
even though the name is `output layer'.
After traning, the neural network generates schematic edit command
from the output layer
based on its training, as shown (c) and (c') in Fig. \ref{fig:nn_schem}.

   \label{fig:input_encode}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

%To feed schematics and editing command to neural network,
%they are necessary to be encoded into vectors composed of real numbers.
Figure \ref{fig:input_encode} shows the way to encode schematic
for input layer of the neural network.
A 2-dimensional schematic is at first mapped to a 3-dimensional space
where z-axes is type of circuit element, like nets, ports or gates.
After that, a vector is achieved by concatenating the 3-dimensional space
into 1-dimensional vector.

Figure \ref{fig:input_encode} (a) shows a logic schematic composed of
inputs ports, output ports, an and-gate, a not-gate,
horizontal nets, vertical nets, and a connecting point.
Figure \ref{fig:input_encode} (b) picks up horizontal nets appearing
in Fig. \ref{fig:input_encode} (a), and they are mapped to depth 0.
The depth 0 is composed of a 2-dimensional matrix which size is the same
as given schematic.
In the right side of (b) in Fig. \ref{fig:input_encode},
dots are located at coordinates where horizontal nets appear.
Points with dots corresponds to a value of 1.0, ones without dots
corrensponds to a value of 0.0.
As shown in figure \ref{fig:input_encode} (c),
vertical nets are mapped to depth 1.
As well, connecting dots, input ports, output ports, and-gates and not-gates
are mapped to depth 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.
Input vectors are finally obtained by flattening the multi-layer of matrices.

\begin{figure}[tb]
 \begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{\hsize}
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{output_encode_02.eps}
   \caption{a way to encode schematic for output vector of neural network}
   \label{fig:output_encode}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:output_encode} shows a way to encode editing commands
for output vector of the neural network.
%A command `move-y, origin (4, 6), destination 2' is shown in the figure
%as an example, which means to vertically move a object at the point (4, 6)
%to y-coordinate of 2.
%The more general explanation of editing commands follow.
%Editing command consist of three elements.
%The first element is a type of command.
%Only 2 kinds of commands are used in this paper,
%which are move-x and move-y,
%although the other commands could be introduced as long as
%the command would not change the semantics of the schematic.
%Move-x means to move a object horizontally.
%Move-y means to move one vertically.
%The second element is a 2-element vector, meaning origin of the command.
%The vector consists of x and y coordinates of the origin.
%The third element is destination.
%The destination means x-coordinate when the type of command
%is move-x, in this work.
%It becomes y-coordinates when the command if move-y.
Move-x is encoded to the vector $[1.0, 0.0]$, 
while move-y is encoded to the vector $[0.0, 0.1]$. 
Origin-x is encoded to one-hot vector, which is
\begin{itemize}
\item $[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, \cdots]$ for 0,
\item $[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, \cdots]$ for 1, 
\item $[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, \cdots]$ for 2,
\end{itemize}
and so on.
For origin-x, the length of the one-hot is the width of the schematic.
The y coordinate is also encoded to one-hot vector which length is
height of the schematic.
As well, destination is one-hot vector which length is
maximum value of width and height of the schematic.
Output vector of the neural network is eventually obtained
by concatenating those 4 one-hot vectors.
