{\small\textbf{Abstract---
 Aesthetic schematics are inevitable to analyze, discuss and debug designs,
while they are often not available.
 This study shows a way to make a schematic cleaner which is written manually
 or automatically generated from netlist or HDL.
 Neural network is introduced and trained with schematic data and
 editting command.
 The trained neural network generates schematic editting command for schematics
 which the network does not know, and it aestheticize the given schematics
 automatically, based on its training.
}}

\section{Introduction}

For a long time and even nowadays,
electronic devices increases their functionality day by day.
The more one has functions, the more difficult the debugging is.

So far, some way have been proposed to automatically generate schematics
from netlist or HDL.
They optimize schematics based on some cost function, e.g.,
the number of crossing point, curve, aspect ratio etc.
On the other hand, optimal shapes of schematics differ for each kind of
circuit, e.g. opamp, reference, oscillator, counter, arithmetic unit,
finite state automaton, etc.
The shape preference depends even on each individual.

The contribution of this work is to apply neural network to make schematics
aesthetic, based on training with test pattern generated by human.

 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:conventional} shows a schematic of a half added
composed only of and, or and not gates, automatically generated
from a netlist by a CAD software.
Figure \ref{fig:human_ha} shows a logically identical one drawn by a human.
It has less curve and cross points than one generated by a CAD.
In this work, a way to revise schematics from one like
figure \ref{fig:conventional} to the other like figure \ref{fig:human_ha}
is shown.

   \label{fig:flow}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure {\ref{fig:flow}} shows a concept how to obtain an aesthetic schamatic.
It has a neural network which learns pairs of schematic and editting command
issued by a human.
Whichever the schematic is given by a conventional schematic generator
or other human,
the trained neural network update the schematic.

\end{figure}

To feed schematics and editing command to neural network,
they are necessary to be encoded into vectors composed of real numbers.
Figure \ref{fig:input_encode} shows the way to encode schematic.
Figure \ref{fig:input_encode} (a) shows a logic schematic composed of
inputs ports, output ports, an and-gate, a not-gate,
horizontal nets, vertical nets, and a connecting point.
Figure \ref{fig:input_encode} (b) picks up horizontal nets appearing
in Figure \ref{fig:input_encode} (a), and they are mapped to depth 0.
Depth 0 composed of a 2-dimensional matrix which size is the same
as given schematic.
In the right side of figure \ref{fig:input_encode},
dots are located at coordinates where horizontal nets appear.
Points with dots corresponds to a value of 1.0, ones without dots
corrensponds to a value of 0.0.
As shown in figure \ref{fig:input_encode} (c),
vertical nets are mapped to depth 1.
As well, connecting dots, input ports, output ports, and-gates and not-gates
are mapped to depth 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.
Input vectors are finally obtained by flattening the multi-layer of matrices.

Figure \ref{fig:output_encode} shows a way to encode editing commands
for output vector of the neural network.
A command `move-y, origin (4, 6), destination 2' is shown in the figure
as an example, which means to vertically move a object at the point (4, 6)
to y-coordinate of 2.
The more general explanation of editing commands follow.
Editing command consist of three elements.
The first element is a type of command.
Only 2 kinds of commands are used in this paper,
which are move-x and move-y,
although the other commands could be introduced as long as
the command would not change the semantics of the schematic.
Move-x means to move a object horizontally.
Move-y means to move one vertically.
The second element is a 2-element vector, meaning origin of the command.
The vector consists of x and y coordinates of the origin.
The third element is destination.
The destination means x-coordinate when the type of command
is move-x, in this work.
It becomes y-coordinates when the command if move-y.
Move-x is encoded to the vector $[1.0, 0.0]$, 
while move-y is encoded to the vector $[0.0, 0.1]$. 
The x coordinate of origin is encoded to so-called one-hot vector,
which is
$[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, \cdots]$ for 0,
$[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, \cdots]$ for 1, 
$[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, \cdots]$ for 2,
and so on. The length of one-hot vector is chosen as the width of
the schematic.
The y coordinate is also encoded to one-hot vector which length is
height of the schematic.
As well, destination is one-hot vector which length is
maximum value of width and height of the schematic.
Output vector of the neural network is eventually obtained
by concatenating those 4 one-hot vectors.
